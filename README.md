Computation and Visualization for Analytics

## Course Overview
This course covers the basics of data visualization, introducing students to static and interactive visualization charts and techniques that reveal information, patterns, interactions, and comparisons by paying attention to details such as color encoding, shape selection, spatial layout, and annotation. Based on these fundamentals of analytical thinking, the course then focuses on data visualization techniques and the use of current software tools that support data exploration, analytics-based storytelling, knowledge discovery, and decision-making in engineering, healthcare operations, manufacturing, and related applications.

## Objectives
- To understand the principles and methodologies of visualization.
- To learn how to explore data using visualization tools.
- To design, validate, and critique visualizations.
- To implement interactive data visualizations.
